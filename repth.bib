	abstract = {The primary goal of these lectures is to introduce a beginner to the finite dimensional representations of Lie groups and Lie algebras. Since this goal is shared by quite a few other books, we should explain in this Preface how our approach differs, although the potential reader can probably see this better by a quick browse through the book. Representation theory is simple to define: it is the study of the ways in which a given group may act on vector spaces. It is almost certainly unique, however, among such clearly delineated subjects, in the breadth of its interest to mathematicians. This is not surprising: group actions are ubiquitous in 20th century mathematics, and where the object on which a group acts is not a vector space, we have learned to replace it by one that is \{e. g. , a cohomology group, tangent space, etc. \}. As a consequence, many mathematicians other than specialists in the field \{or even those who think they might want to be\} come in contact with the subject in various ways. It is for such people that this text is designed. To put it another way, we intend this as a book for beginners to learn from and not as a reference. This idea essentially determines the choice of material covered here. As simple as is the definition of representation theory given above, it fragments considerably when we try to get more specific.},

	abstract = {These are lecture notes that arose from a representation theory course given by the first author to the remaining six authors in March 2004 within the framework of the Clay Mathematics Institute Research Academy for high school students, and its extended version given by the first author to {MIT} undergraduate math students in the Fall of 2008. The notes cover a number of standard topics in representation theory of groups, Lie algebras, and quivers, and contain many problems and exercises. They should be accessible to students with a strong background in linear algebra and a basic knowledge of abstract algebra, and may be used for an undergraduate or introductory graduate course in representation theory.},

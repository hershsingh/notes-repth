\chapter{Representations of Finite Groups}
\section{Definitions}
\label{sec:definitions}

Let $G$ be a finite group, $V$ be a finite dimensional complex vector space.

A \emph{representation} of $G$ on $V$ is a group homomorphism 
\begin{align}
    \rho:  G\to \GL(V), 
\end{align}
where $\GL(V)$ is the group of automorphisms of $V$. Even though the ``representation" is really the the vector space $V$ \emph{and} the homomorphism $\rho$, but it is common (especially by physicists) to refer to $V$ itself as the representation. 

\begin{insight}
We say that this map gives $V$ the structure of a G-module. This agrees with the  definition of a R-module (R is a ring) that I have studied earlier. An R-module is simply a vector space defined over a ring, instead of a field. So the ring elements act as the \emph{scalars}. Of course, the description must include a rule for the `interaction' of the scalars with the vectors. To be a module, the interaction must be \emph{linear}.  
In this case, the group homomorphism $\rho$ gives us that rule of interaction between the vectors (elements of $V$) and the scalars (elements of $G$). For $g\in G, v \in V$, $$gv\equiv\rho(g)v \in V$$
\end{insight}


A vector space homomorphism $\phi: V\to W$ is a morphism between the two representations $V$ and $W$ if the following diagram commutes:
\begin{equation} \begin{CD}
  V @>\phi>> W\\
  @VgVV @VVgV\\
  V @>\phi>> W\\
\end{CD} \end{equation}

That is, $\phi g=g\phi$ for all $g\in G$. This makes the group elements \emph{behave like scalars under module homomorphisms}. Such morphisms of representations are also called $G$-\emph{linear map} or a \emph{$G$ intertwiner}.

\begin{insight}
   Why is this is a good definition? Seems to be inspired from module homomorphisms. This is natural in some sense - Figure that out.
\end{insight}

$\Ker \phi,\ \Image \phi,\ \Coker \phi = V/\Image\phi$ are also $G$-modules. This is solely because of the commutativity of the above diagram.
\begin{itemize}
    \item If $v\in \Ker \phi$, then $\phi(gv) = g\phi(v) = 0$. So $gv$ also $\in \Ker \phi$. $\blacksquare$.
    \item If $v\in \Image \phi$, then let $\phi(v) = w$. So $\phi(gv)=g\phi(v)=gw \in W$. So $gv$ also $\in \Image \phi$. $\blacksquare$.
\end{itemize}

One of the goals of our study is, given a representation, to develop tools for constructing other, preferably all, representations of the group. 
Some examples of representations that can be constructed from $V$ and $W$

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
    \item Tensor product $V\otimes W$ via
        \begin{align}
            g(v\otimes w) = g(v) \otimes g(w)
        \end{align}
    \item Tensor power $V^{\otimes n}$ and the \emph{exterior power}  $\Lambda^n(V)$ and the \emph{symmetric power} $\Sym^n(V)$ are its subrepresentations.
    \item the dual $V^* = \Hom(V,\CC)$. This is a little tricky though. The action of $G$ on $V^*$ must be such that it preserves the natural inner product, denoted by $\<\ ,\ \>$, between them. So, if we have a representation $(V^*,\rho^*)$ and $(V,\rho)$, then we should have
        \begin{align}
            \rho^*_g(u^*)(\rho_g v) = u^*(v)
        \end{align}
        where I have written $\rho_g=\rho(g)$ for a cleaner notation, and $u^*\in V^*,\ v\in V$. 
        \begin{insight}
            Remember the definition of the transpose map. If we have a map $f: V\to W$, then the transpose of $\rho$ is a map $^t\rho: W^*\to V^*$ such that
            \begin{align}
                ^tf(\phi) = f\cdot \phi \quad\quad\forall \phi\in W^*.
            \end{align}
            It's a good idea to make commutative diagrams out of statements like the above:
            \begin{center}
            \begin{tikzpicture}[commutative diagram, node distance=1.5cm]
                \node (V) {$V$};
                \node (CC) [below right of=V] {$\CC$};
                \node (W) [below left of=V] {$W$};
                \draw [arrow] (V) -- (CC) node [midway] {$^tf(\phi)=\phi\cdot f$};
                \draw [arrow] (V) -- (W) node [midway,auto=right] {$f$};
                \draw [arrow] (W) -- (CC) node [midway] {$\phi$};
            \end{tikzpicture}
            \end{center}
        \end{insight}
        If we now define
        \begin{align}
            \rho^*(g) &= \prescript{t}{}\rho(g^{-1})
            \label{eqn:defn_dualrep}
        \end{align}
        we get
        \begin{align*}
            \rho_g^*(u*)(\rho_g v) &= \prescript{t}{}\rho_{g^{-1}}(u^*)(\rho_g v)\\
                &= u^*\cdot\rho_{g^{-1}} (\rho_g v) \\
                &= u^* (\rho_{g^{-1}g} v) \\
                &= u^*(v).
        \end{align*}
        The definition \eqref{eqn:defn_dualrep} preserves the inner product, and is a thus a sane definition.
    \item $\Hom(V,W)$ by the identification, $\Hom(V,W)=V^*\otimes W$ (see appendix \ref{cha:tensor_product}). If $(\phi: V\to W)\in \Hom(V,W)$ then let $\sum_i \phi_{ij} v_i^*\otimes w_j$. Writing out the action of this on $u\in V$,
        \begin{align*}
            (g\phi)(gu) &= \left[ g \sum\phi_{ij} v^*_i \otimes w_j \right] (gu) \\
                &= \Big[ \sum_{ij}\phi_{ij} gv^*_i \otimes gw_j \Big] (gu) \\
                &= \sum \phi_{ij} \<gv_i^*, gu\> g w_j\\
                &= \sum \phi_{ij} \<v_i^*, u\> g w_j\\
        \end{align*}
        This gives us
        \begin{align}
            (g\phi)(gu) &= g\cdot\phi(u)\quad \forall u\in  V.
            \label{eqn:linearmap_groupaction}
        \end{align}
        \begin{insight}
            Note that you cannot multiply both sides by $g^{-1}$ to imply that $\phi(gu)=\phi(u)$. This can't be done since the action of $G$ on $V^*$ is \emph{not associative}. That means,
            \begin{align*}
                (g\phi)(u) \neq g\cdot \phi(u),
            \end{align*}
            as can be seen by simply taking, say, $\phi=v^*\otimes w$. LHS becomes $\< gv^*, u \>gw$ while RHS becomes $\<v^*,w\>gw$.
        \end{insight}
        \begin{center}
            \begin{tikzpicture}[commutative diagram]
                \node (V1) {$V$};
                \node (W1) [right of=V] {$W$};
                \node (V2) [below of=V1] {$V$};
                \node (W2) [below of=W1] {$W$};
                \draw [arrow] (V1) -- (W1) node [midway, auto=right] {$\phi$};
                \draw [arrow] (V2) -- (W2) node [midway, auto=right] {$g\phi$};
                \draw [arrow] (V1) -- (V2) node [midway, left] {$g$};
                \draw [arrow] (W1) -- (W2) node [midway] {$g$};
            \end{tikzpicture}
        \end{center}
        Ofcouse, if $\phi$ is a $G$-linear map (a map between reprentations $V$ and $W$), then we also have $g\cdot\phi = \phi\cdot g$ for all $g\in G$. Consider the space $\Hom_G(V,W) \subset \Hom(V,W)$, which consists of maps from $V$ to $W$ invariant under the action $G$. If $\phi\in \Hom_G(V,W)$, then we have $(g\phi)(gu)=g\phi(u)$ and $(g\phi)(u)=\phi(u)$ (by invariance of the map under $G$). Thus we have $g\phi(u)=\phi(gu)$. The converse is also easily seen to be true.Therefore, $\Hom(V,W)$ is space of all $G$-linear maps $V\to W$.  \Solution{1.2}{FH}

\section{Schur's Lemma}
\label{sec:schur_s_lemma}

\begin{lemma}[Schur's Lemma]
    Let $V,\ W$ be irreps of a group $G$ and $\phi: V\to W$ a $G$-linear map. Then,
    \begin{enumerate}[(i)]
        \item either $\phi$ is 0 or an isomorphism;
        \item if $V=W$, then $\phi=\lambda I$.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\section{Examples}
\label{sec:examples}

We observe that any $g\in G$ gives a map $\rho(g): V\to V$. In general, this is not a $G$-linear map however. For $\rho(g)$ to be a $G$ linear map, ...
%\begin{align}
    %g(h(v)) &= h(g(v))\quad\quad \forall h\in G
%\end{align}
%which just says that the set of all $G$-linear maps in $\rho(G)$ is precisely the center of $G$, given by $Z(G)$.

\subsection{Abelian Groups}
\label{sub:abelian_groups}

If $G$ is an abelian group, and $V$ is an irrep, then $\rho(g)$ is a $G$-linear map.By Schur's Lemma, $\rho(g)=\lambda I$. That means that any proper subspace of $V$ is actually invariant under the action of $G$, and is a thus a subrepresentation. But since $V$ is irreducible, this can only mean that $V$ has no non-trivial proper subspace, which implies that $V$ is one-dimensional. Therefore, any representation of an abelian group is just an element of the \emph{dual group}
\begin{align}
    \rho: G \to \CC^*.
\end{align}

%Incidentally, this is also the definition of the \emph{dual group}.

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{$S_3$}{S3}}
%\label{sub:_s_3_}

\begin{insight}
    Remember that $S_3$ is the group of permutations of three objects. Algebraically, it can be thought to be generated by the elements
    \begin{align}
        \{1,\ \tau,\ \tau^2, \sigma,\ \sigma\tau,\ \sigma\tau^2\}
    \end{align}
    subject to the conditions
    \begin{align}
        \tau^3=1,\quad \sigma^2=1,\quad (\sigma\tau)^2=1.
    \end{align}
    You can tell that $\sigma$ is a 2-cycle and $\tau$ is a 3-cycle.
    
\end{insight}

Lets now discuss the case of the \emph{simplest non-abelian group}, $S_3$. We already know three representations to begin with:
\begin{enumerate}[(i)] 
    \makethislistcompact
    \item the trivial representation,
        \begin{align}
            \rho(g) &= I
        \end{align}
    \item the alternating representation
        \begin{align}
            \rho(g) &= \sgn(g),
        \end{align}
    \item the natural permutation representation.\\
        But this is not irreducible. It can be easily seen that the subspace spanned by the vector $(1,1,1)$ is invariant under $G$. So, the space $V$ complimentary to it is another (hopefully irreducible!) representation. If $v=(z_1,z_2,z_3) \in V$, then 
        \begin{align}
            (z_1,z_2,z_2)\cdot(1,1,1) &= 0\\
            \implies z_1 + z_2 + z_3 &= 0.
        \end{align}
        We thus have
        \begin{align}
            V &= \{(z_1,z_2,z_3) \in \CC^3: z_1 + z_2 + z_3 =0\}.
        \end{align}
        Now if this further has an invariant subspace, it must be spanned by an element of the form $(z_1,z_2,-z_1-z_2)$. Applying a few permutations will convince you immediately that this is not an invariant subspace. Therefore, the representation we have is irreducible, called the \emph{standard representation} of $S_3$.
\end{enumerate}
We now want to characterize any arbitrary representation $W$ of $S_3$. To do so, we first look at the action of the abelian subgroup $ U_3 = \ZZ/3 \in G$ (generated by $x$) on $W$. If $v\in W$ is an eigenvector of $\rho(x)$, then 
\begin{align}
    \tau \sigma (v) &= \sigma\tau^2 (v)\\
        &= \omega^2 (\sigma v)
\end{align}
This means that if $v$ is eigenvector of $\tau$ with the eigenvalue $\omega$, then $\sigma v$ is also an eigenvector with the eigenvalue $\omega^2$.
To find the decomposition of the $W$, we go through the following steps:
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
    \item Start with an eigenvector $v$ of $\tau$, which has the eigenvalue $w^i$.
    \item If $w^i\neq 1$, then $\sigma v$ is an eigenvector independent of $\tau$ with the eigenvalue $w^{2i}$. In this case, $\{v,\sigma v\}$ form a two dimensional subspace of $W$ invariant under $S_3$ (as $\sigma$ just exhanges $v$ and $\sigma v$). In fact, this subrepresentation is isomorphic to the standard representation and is thus irreducible.
    \item If $w^i = 1$, then $\sigma v$ may or may not be independent of $v$.
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item If $\sigma v$ is independent of $v$, then $v + \sigma v$ spans a subspace isomorphic to the trivial represntation and $v - \sigma v$ spans a subspace isomorphic to the alternating representation. 
            \item If $\sigma v$ and $v$ are not linearly independent, then 
                $\sigma v= \lambda v$ for some $\lambda\in \{1,-1\}$ (since $\sigma^2=I$). If $\lambda=1$, then $\CC v$ is isomorphic to the trivial representation and if $\lambda=-1$, then $\CC v$ is isomorphic to the alternating representation.
        \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

Note that this allows to find all irreps of a given representation $W$!

\Solution{1.12(a)}{FH} Lets use this approach to find out the irreps of th regular representation $R$ of $S_3$. A general vector in the space looks like this
\begin{align}
    v &= a_1 + a_2 \tau + a_3 \tau^2 + b_1\sigma + b_2 \sigma\tau + b_3\sigma \tau^2 
\end{align}

The eigenvalues of $\tau$ are $\{1,\omega,\omega^2\}$. 
\begin{enumerate}
    \makethislistcompact
    \item For eigenvalue $=1$, we have $v=1 + \tau + \tau^2$ and $\sigma v = \sigma + \sigma\tau + \sigma\tau^2$. Thus $\CC (v+\sigma v)\isomorphic \triv$ and $\CC (v-\sigma v) \isomorphic \sgn$ are two irreps.
    \item For eigenvalue $=\omega$, we get on solving $\tau \alpha = \omega \alpha$
        \begin{align}
            \alpha &= \omega^2\tau + \omega\tau + \tau^2
        \end{align}
        With $\beta = \sigma \alpha$, we get the subspace spanned by $\{\alpha,\beta\}$ to be isomorphic to the standard representation.
    \item For eigenvalue $=\omega^2$, we get 
        \begin{align}
            \alpha' &= \omega^2 + \omega\tau + \tau^2\\
            \beta' = \sigma\alpha &= \omega^2\sigma + \omega\sigma\tau + \sigma\tau^2
        \end{align}
        The subspace spanned by $\{\alpha',\beta'\}$ is again isomorphic to the standard representation.
\end{enumerate}
We have enumerated six linearly independent eigenvectors and therefore exhausted all of them. We thus get
\begin{align}
   R &\isomorphic \triv \oplus \sgn \oplus (\std)^2 \quad\quad\square    
\end{align}
\Solution{1.14}{FH} For an irrep $V$ of a finite group $G$, there is a unique Hermitian inner product preserved by $G$. Say there are two Hermitian products, $H$ and $H'$, preserved by $G$. Any Hermitian inner product sets up an isomorphism between $V$ and $V^*$. Let that map be given by
\begin{align}
    \phi_1(v) &= H_1(v,\cdot) \in V^*\\
    \phi_2(v) &= H_2(v,\cdot) \in V^*
\end{align}
\begin{insight}
    Write details about the isomorphism between $V$ and $V^*$. Crucial is the positive-definiteness of the inner product. Not sure where the Hermiticity of the inner product is important.
\end{insight}
\begin{align}
    V^* \xleftarrow{\phi_1} V \xrightarrow{\phi_2} V^*
\end{align}
Now, the map $\phi = \phi_2\cdot\phi_1^{-1}$ is an isomorphism of vector spaces. It is also a $G$-linear map since its the composition of $G$-linear maps. Therefore, $\phi$ is an isomorphism between two irreps. By Schur's lemma, $\phi=\lambda\cdot I$, where $\lambda$ is any scalar. This gives us
\begin{align}
    H_2(v,\cdot) &= \phi(H_1(v,\cdot)) \\
        &= \lambda H_1(v,\cdot)\quad\quad\qed
\end{align}

\noindent\Todo{\Solution{1.13(a)}{FH}}\\
\Solution{1.13(b)}{FH} Is $\Sym^n(\Sym^mV)\isomorphic \Sym^m(\Sym^n V)$? No, since the dimensions don't match on both sides.
\begin{align}
    \dim \Sym^n(\Sym^mV) &= ^{{}^{\dim V - 1 + m}C_{m} -1 +n}C_{n}
\end{align}
The above equation is clearly not symmetric in $m$ and $n$. So the isomorphism can not hold in general.


\chapter{Character Theory}
\label{cha:character_theory}
\begin{definition}
    If $V$ is a representatin of $G$, its \emph{character} $\chi_V$ is the complex-valued functin on the group defined by
    \begin{align}
        \chi_V(g) &= \Tr(g|_V),
    \end{align}
    the trace of $g$ on $V$.
\end{definition}

We shall drop the subscript $V$ when it's obvious.

Some properties
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $\chi_V$ is a class function, which means that it is constant on conjugacy classes  of $G$.
        \begin{align}
            \chi(hgh^{-1}) &= \chi(g)
        \end{align}
    \item 
\end{enumerate}

\section{First Projection Formula}
\label{sec:first_projection_formula}
Let us define $V^G$ as the elements of $V$ fixed under the action of $G$.
\begin{align}
    V^G=\{v\in V: gv=v\ \forall g\in G \}
\end{align}
The sub space $V^G$ is actually the direct sum of the trivial subrepresentations.

Now, the endomorpism $\varphi \in \End(V)$, 
\begin{align}
    \varphi &= \frac{1}{|G|} \sum_{g\in G} g
\end{align}
is $G$ linear, since $h\varphi h^{-1} = \frac{1}{|G|}\sum_{g\in G} hgh^{-1} = \varphi$.  Infact, $\varphi$ is projection of $V$ to $V^G$.

So, now we have a way of finding the direct sum of the trivial subreprentations of $V$. The trace of this map is would be the dimension of $V_G$ [\Todo {Why?}], which is the number of copies of trivial representations in $V^G$.

\begin{insight}
    \Todo{ For an arbitrary linear map (projection?) $T: V\to W$, do we have $\Tr T =\dim W$ ?  }
\end{insight}

\begin{align}
    \dim V^G &= \Tr (\varphi)\\
        &= \frac{1}{|G|}\sum_{g\in G} \Tr(g)\\
        &= \frac{1}{|G|}\sum_{g\in G}\chi_V(g)
        \label{eqn:dimV_G}
\end{align}
In particular, if $V$ is irreducible, then it has no trivial subrepresentations and thus
\begin{align}
    \sum_{g\in G} \chi_V(g) &= 0\quad\quad\text{if $V$ is an nontrivial irrep}.
\end{align}

We know that $\Hom(V,W)^G$, the set of all homorphisms $V\to W$ fixed under $G$, is just the space of all $G$-linear maps $V\to W$. [\Todo{reference here.}]
\begin{insight}
    Given a $G$-linear map $\phi: V\to W$, where $V$ is a an irrep, $\phi$ defines an isomorphism between $V$ and $\Image(\phi)$ (since $\ker \phi$ is a subrepresentation of $V$, and so must be $\{0\}$) Now, other such $\phi$ would give us copies of $V$ in $W$. \Todo{The dimensionality of the space $\Hom_G(V,W)$ thus tells us the multiplicity of $V$ in $W$.}
\end{insight}

By Schur's lemma, if $V$ and $W$ are both irreducible then
\begin{equation}
    \dim \Hom_G(V,W) = 
        \begin{cases}    
            1   &\text{if } V\isomorphic W \\
            0   &\text{if } V\ncong  W
        \end{cases}
\end{equation}
Since we have $\Hom_G(V,W)\isomorphic V^*\otimes W$,
\begin{align}
    \chi_{\Hom_G(V,W)}(g) &= \overline{\chi_V(g)}\cdot\chi_W(g)
\end{align}
Using \eqref{eqn:dimV_G} here, we get the nice result
\begin{align}
        %\frac{1}{|G|}\sum_{g\in G}\chi_V(g) &= 
        \frac{1}{|G|}\sum_{g\in G} \overline{\chi_V(g)}\cdot\chi_W(g) 
        &= \begin{cases}    
            1   &\text{if } V\isomorphic W \\
            0   &\text{if } V\ncong  W
        \end{cases}
\end{align}
This inspires us to define a dot product on the space of all class functions (functions that are defined on the conjugacy classes of a group) of $G$,
\begin{align}
    \CC_{\text{class}}(G) &= \{\text{class functions on $G$}\},
\end{align}
as
\begin{align}
    (\alpha,\beta) &= \frac{1}{|G|} \sum_{g\in G} \overline{\alpha(g)} \beta(g).
    \label{eqn:dotproduct_classfunctions}
\end{align}
In respect this dot product, the characters of irreps are orthornormal.

\chapter{Induced Reprentations}
\label{cha:induced_reprentations}
\Todo{Don't really understand the motivation for this section.}
\emph{Reference: Etingof.}

Given a subgroup $H\subset G$, and $(\rho_V, V)$, a representation of $G$, we can easily construct a representation for $H$ by simply restricting $\rho_V$ to $H$, which we denote by $\rho_V|_H$.

However, if want to construct a representation of $G$ from a representation of $H$, then we need to think a little more about it. 

Think of the elements of $V$ as functions of $G$, that is, every element $v\in V$ defines a map $v: G\to V$ given by
\begin{align}
    v(g) &= \rho(g) v.
\end{align}
Now, we already know how $v(\cdot)$ acts on $H$. We want to extend that action to $G$. The least we could do is to ensure that the action on $G$ is consistent with the known action on $H$. So, we enforce that
\begin{align}
    v(hg) = h\cdot v(g) &= \rho_V(h) v(g)\quad \forall h\in H,\ g\in G.
\end{align}

\subsection{Universal enveloping algebra}
\label{sub:universal_enveloping_algebra}

A \emph{universal enveloping algebra} is, in some sense, the most general associative algebra which contains a given lie algebra. 

Let $U(L)$ be an associative algebra with unit and $L$ be a lie algebra. $U(L)$ is the universal enveloping algebra if we have a map $\epsilon: L\to U(L)$ such that
\begin{enumerate}
    \makethislistcompact
    \item $\epsilon$ is Lie algebra homomorphism. This means that it is linear and it preserves the Lie bracket:
        \begin{align}
            \epsilon[x,y] &= \epsilon(x)\epsilon(y) - \epsilon(y) \epsilon(x)
        \end{align}
    \item it satisfies a \emph{universal property}. If $A$ is any associative algebra with unit and $\alpha: L \to A $ is any Lie algebra then there exists a unique $\phi: U(L)\to A$ such that the following diagram commutes.
        \begin{center}
            \begin{tikzpicture}[commutative diagram]
                \node (L) {$L$};
                \node (UL) [below right of=L] {$U(L)$};
                \node (A) [below left of=L] {$A$};
                \draw [arrow] (L) --(UL) node [midway, auto=left] {$\epsilon$};
                \draw [arrow] (L) --(A) node [midway, auto=right] {$\alpha$};
                \draw [arrow, dashed] (UL) --(A) node [midway, auto=below] {$\exists!\ \phi$};
            \end{tikzpicture}
        \end{center}
\end{enumerate}
\begin{insight}
    Given $(\epsilon_1, U_1)$ and $(\epsilon_2,U_2)$ we can see get maps $\phi_1: U_1\to U_2$  and $\phi_2: U_2\to U_1$ such that 
    $\phi_1\cdot\phi_2$ is identity \Todo{on $\epsilon_1(L)$} and 
    $\phi_2\cdot\phi_1$ is identity \Todo{on $\epsilon_2(L)$}. 
    
    \Todo{How can we say that their composition is identity on the whole of $U_1$ and $U_2$?}
\end{insight}
Universal enveloping algebras are unique upto an isomorphism due to this universal property.

\subsection{Tensor Algebra}
\label{sub:tensor_algebra}
$i:V\to T(V)$ such that for any map $\alpha: V\to A$, where $A$ is an associative algebra, there exists an a map linear map $\psi: T(V)\to A$ such that the following diagram commutes

\begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[commutative diagram]
        \node (V) {$V$};
        \node (TV) [below right of=V] {$T(V)$};
        \node (A) [below left of=V] {$A$};
        \draw [arrow] (V) --(TV) node [midway, auto=left] {$i$};
        \draw [arrow] (V) --(A) node [midway, auto=right] {$\alpha$};
        \draw [arrow, dashed] (UL) --(A) node [midway, auto=below] {$\exists!\ \psi$};
    \end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}


\subsection{Construction}
\label{sub:construction}
Let $L$ be a Lie algebra and let $I$ be the two sided ideal generated by the elements $[x,y]-x\otimes y + y\otimes x$, then

\begin{align}
    U(L) &= T(L)/I
\end{align}

is a universal enveloping algebra for $L$.

We need to show that this satisfies the universal property. Set $V=L$ in the diagram for tensor algebra $T(V)$ to get

\begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[commutative diagram]
        \node (L) {$L$};
        \node (TL) [below right of=L] {$T(L)$};
        \node (A) [below left of=L] {$A$};
        \draw [arrow] (L) --(TL) node [midway, auto=left] {$i$};
        \draw [arrow] (L) --(A) node [midway, auto=right] {$\alpha$};
        \draw [arrow, dashed] (UL) --(A) node [midway, auto=below] {$\exists!\ \psi$};
    \end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
If, additionally, $\alpha$ is a Lie algebra homomorphism, then 
\begin{align}
    \alpha[x,y] &= \alpha(x)\alpha(y) -\alpha(y) \alpha(x)\quad\forall x,y\in L.
\end{align}
But since $\alpha=\psi\cdot i$
\begin{align}
    \psi([x,y] -x\otimes y - y\otimes x) =0
\end{align}
Therefore $I\subset \ker \psi$, and we get that there is a unique map $\overline\phi: T/I \to A$ such that the following diagram commutes

\begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[commutative diagram]
        \draw [->, opacity=0.3] (0,-0.7) arc (90:-250:5pt);
        \draw [->, opacity=0.3] (0,-1.9) arc (90:-250:5pt);

        \node (L) {$L$};
        \node (TL) [below right of=L] {$T(L)$};
        \node (A) [below left of=L] {$A$};
        \node (T/I) [below left of=TL] {$T/I$};
        \draw [arrow] (L) --(TL) node [midway, auto=left] {$i$};
        \draw [arrow] (L) --(A) node [midway, auto=right] {$\alpha$};
        \draw [arrow] (TL) --(A) node [midway, auto=below] {$\psi$};
        \draw [arrow] (TL) --(T/I) node [midway, auto=below] {$\phi$};
        \draw [arrow, dashed] (T/I) --(A) node [midway, auto=below] {$ \overline{\phi}$};
    \end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
Thus,  we have the a lie algebra $T/I$ and a map $\epsilon=\phi\cdot i: L\to T/I$ such that the universal property is satisfied. \qed



\subsection{Extension of Lie algebra homorphism to its UEA}
\label{sub:extension_of_lie_algebra_homorphism_to_its_uea}
Given map $h: L\to M$ between two lie algebras $L$ and $M$, the universal property implies the existence of a associative algebra homomorphism $U(L)\to U(M)$ as shown in the diagram:
\begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[commutative diagram]
        \node (L) {$L$};
        \node (M) [right of=L] {$M$};
        \node (UL) [below of=L] {$U(L)$};
        \node (UM) [right of=UL] {$U(M)$};
        \draw [arrow] (L) -- (M) node [midway, above] {$h$};
        \draw [arrow] (L) -- (UL) node [midway, left] {$\epsilon_L$};
        \draw [arrow] (M) -- (UM) node [midway, right] {$\epsilon_M$};
        \draw [arrow, opacity=0.3] (L) -- (UM) node [midway, auto,  shift={(-5pt,0pt)}] {$\epsilon_M\cdot h$};

\chapter{Tensor Product}
\label{cha:tensor_product}

Let $V,\ W$ be vector spaces. A tensor product is a vector space $V\otimes W$ equipped with a bilinear map
\begin{align}
    V\times W \to V\otimes W\\
    (v,w) \mapsto v\otimes w
\end{align}
such that it is \emph{universal}. That is, given any other vector space $U$ and a bilinear map $\beta: V\times W\to U$, there is unique map $\beta': V\otimes W \to U$ such that $\beta'(v\otimes w) = \beta(v,w)$. The following diagram commutes:

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}[commutative diagram] 
    \node (a) {$V\times W$};
    \node (b) [below right of=a] {$V\otimes W$};
    \node (c) [below left of=a] {$U$};
    \draw [arrow] (a) -- (b) node [midway] {$\otimes$};
    \draw [arrow] (a) -- (c) node [midway,auto=right] {$\beta$};
    \draw [exists] (b) -- (c) node [midway] {$\exists!\ \beta'$};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
The universality requirement means that the tensor product thus defined is unique upto an isomorphism. Let there be another tensor product $V\otimes' W$ (a vector space and a correspoding map that takes $(v,w)\mapsto v\otimes' w$) that is also universal. Then it immediately implies that there is a bijection between $V\otimes W$ and $V\otimes' W$ since
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}[commutative diagram] 
    \node (a) {$V\times W$};
    \node (b) [below right of=a] {$V\otimes W$};
    \node (c) [below left of=a] {$V\otimes' W$};
    \draw [arrow] (a) -- (b) node [midway] {$\otimes$};
    \draw [arrow] (a) -- (c) node [midway,auto=right] {$\otimes'$};
    \draw [exists] (c.5) -- (b.175) node [midway, above] {$\exists!$};
    \draw [exists] (b.185) -- (c.355) node [midway] {$\exists!$};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

\begin{theorem}[]
    $\Hom(V,W) \isomorphic V^*\otimes W$ as vector spaces.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
   Quick Check: Set $W=\CC$ so that we get $\Hom(V,\CC)\isomorphic V^*\otimes 1 = V^*$, which is the definition of the dual space $V^*$.

   Given $(\beta: V\to W) \in \Hom(V,W)$, define the map $\phi: \Hom(V,W)\to V^* \otimes W $ such that 
   \begin{align}
       \phi(\beta) = \sum_{i,j} \beta_{ij} v_i^* \otimes w_j
   \end{align}
   where $\{v_i\}$ and $\{w_j\}$ are orthonormal basis for $V$ and $W$ respectively and $\beta_{ij} = \beta(v_i)^T w_j$.
   This is a homorphism of vector spaces. The inverse map is obvious.
\end{proof}

\section{Exterior Products and Symmetric Products}
\label{sec:exterior_products_and_symmetric_products}

\subsection{Definitions}
\label{sub:definitions}

\subsection{Some Combinatorics}
\label{sub:some_combinatorics}

Lets find out the dimensions of the vector space $\Lambda^k V$, where $V$ is an $n$-dimensional vector space.
If $\{e_i\}$ is a basis for $V$, we know that a basis for $\Lambda^k V$ is 
\begin{align}
    \{e_{i_1}\wedge e_{i_2} \wedge\cdots \wedge e_{i_k} : i_1 < i_2 < \cdots < i_k \}.
\end{align}
How many vectors are there in this basis? This can be asnwered by looking at how many ways are there to simply choose $k$ objects from a set of $n$ different objects. Since there is just one of arranging them (in increasing order), that would be the number of vectors in the basis. So,
\begin{align}
    \dim \Lambda^k (V) &= {}^{\dim V}C_k
    \label{eqn:dim_exteriorpower}
\end{align}

What's the dimension of $\Sym^k(V)$? The basis is
\begin{align}
    \{e_{i_1}\cdot e_{i_2} \cdot\cdots \cdot e_{i_k} : i_1 \leq i_2 \leq \cdots \leq i_k \}.
\end{align}
Another way to write that is
\begin{align}
    \{e_1^{a_1}\cdot e_2^{a_2} \cdots e_k^{a_k}\},\quad\text{such that } \sum_i a_i = n,\, a_i\geq 0.
\end{align}
We just need to know how many ways are there to distribute $n$ identical things among $k$ different people with no restriction on the number of things anyone can get. To solve this, introduce $k-1$ identical barriers (denoted by $|$) between $n$ things (denoted by $\circ$)and look at the number of permutations.
\begin{align}
    \circ | \circ | \cdots | \circ
\end{align}
Every permutation here gives possible choice of ${a_1,\dotsc,a_k}$. Therefore,
\begin{align}
    \dim (\Sym^k (V)) &= {}^{\dim V +k-1}C_{k}
    \label{eqn:dim_symmetricpower}
\end{align}
